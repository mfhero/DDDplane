# DDDplane
***
## What is DDDplane?
  DDDplane is a project that begin in Hackthon competition of Peking University. As we have realized  the serious situations
   of Short distance transportation in China where carriers can gain merely benifits from it. 
   So we think in the future there must be an enormous change which the carrier will be unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) instead of human 
   to save the cost. So we designed a scheduling algorithm to solve the problem of UAV scheduling
   when there are lots of tasks and limited UAV.
