# DDDplane
***
## What is DDDplane?
*   DDDplane is a project that begin in Hackthon competition of Peking University. As we have realized  the serious situations
   of Short distance transportation in China where carriers can gain merely benifits from it. 
*   So we think in the future there must be an enormous change which the carrier will be unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) instead
   of human to save the cost. So we designed a scheduling algorithm to solve the problem of UAV scheduling
   when there are lots of tasks and limited UAV.
